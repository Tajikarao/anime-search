# anime-search


## Objectives

The objective of this project is to test different algorithms to find the best way to retrieve the names of anime. We will use existing algorithms but we will also create our own algorithms.


## Supported algorithms:

| Algorithm  | Efficiency |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cosine distance | Can find the expected anime but must be partly well written |
| Damerau–Levenshtein distance | Not suitable for use |
| Jaro–Winkler distance | Can find the expected anime but must be partly well written  |
| Levenshtein distance | Not suitable for use |
| Soundex | Not suitable for use |
